I didn't really encounter any problems that weren't just syntax errors that
I missed here and there. The extra credit took a minute to fix up, but I just
didn't think to use my functions correctly.

Fairly easy program problem solving wise. I felt like the number of classes and
member functions were excessive in some cases, but I get that's part of the 
practice of it.

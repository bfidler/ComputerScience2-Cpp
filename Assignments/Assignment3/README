I encountered a bunch of little snags here and there, but I don't really think 
I need to list them. Most of them were dumb mistakes, and some things were
just topics that I just hadn't learned well enough before. 

I actually liked this assignment although it felt like it dragged on, but that
was probably becuase I kept getting distracted and its really close to summer.
So that's on me.

My image is a funky looking tiger paw I guess. I did it kind of fast and kept the
old colors from your sample image, so it definitely looks weird. 

I feel like I did a good job with comments this time as well.
